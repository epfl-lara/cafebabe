Cafebabe is a tiny Scala library to generate JVM class files. It was originally
developed for the Compiler Construction course taught at EPFL. See
http://lara.epfl.ch/w/Teaching for more info.

The wiki on the original GitHub repository contains some documentation [here](https://github.com/psuter/cafebabe/wiki).
